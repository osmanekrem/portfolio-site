            Hello there! I&apos;m Osman Ekrem, a passionate frontend developer
            with a knack for crafting engaging user experiences. Born as the
            digital age was dawning in late 2006, II&apos;ve been intertwined
            with code from my middle school days. It all started with Python. My
            journey through Java and other languages led me to the vibrant world
            of frontend development during my high school years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I stand as a frontend developer, orchestrating symphonies of
            ReactJS, Next.js, and Angular to create harmonious websites that
            sing to the userI&apos;s soul. My skills are an open book, just take
            a peek at the skills tab - no need for a Bat-Signal to find them!
